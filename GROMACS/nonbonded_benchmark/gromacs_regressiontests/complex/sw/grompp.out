Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298.15 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.840 nm, buffer size 0.040 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.804 nm, buffer size 0.004 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Using a fourier grid of 32x32x32, spacing 0.058 0.058 0.058
This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
